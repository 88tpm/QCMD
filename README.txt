This repository is structured with the code for each publication located in a folder with a similar title to the paper wich cites here. Each of these folders can be run in full as long as the full folder is added to the MATLAB path. Individual read me files are present in each of these folders. Having the other folders present also gives users to explore other publications and code that they may have not come across but which will still be useful.

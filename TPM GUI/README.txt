To use the graphical user interface:
1 add "GUI functions" to the path of MATLAB
2 Type TPM_GUI into the command console
3 After a few seconds you should see the new window pop up

When using the GUI there are a few notes:
1 Text responses generated are based around the Film and Bulk properties and independant of the x and y axis ranges
2 A graph will always be produced
3 Top TPM-sensitivity scores produced by the GUI are only two dimensional, for higher dimensonalities please use "combo" in the "TPM-sensativity" folder in this download
4 Manual code is all self contained within the "TPM-sensativity"
